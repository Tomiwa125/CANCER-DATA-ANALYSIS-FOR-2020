The dats used in this project was cited from WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION and WORLD CANCER RESEARCH FUNDS INTERNATIONAL.
This project was built with to put into visualization the cases and deaths among both sexes and countries caused by cancer, creating awareness of the deadliness of this disease.
Given lungs cancer has the most deaths among mex and breast cancer has the most deaths among women, i believe this discussion and awareness can not be over emphasized.
